## Problem Statement
Decentralized communities need transparent decision-making processes. Current methods (like off-chain polls) are not always secure or verifiable.

---

## Proposed Solution
We propose a DAO Voting dApp where members can vote on proposals using their wallet. Votes will be recorded on-chain and validated with Soundness Layer for transparency and fairness.

---

## Key Features
- On-chain Voting: Every vote is immutable and transparent.  
- Weighted Voting: Options for equal voting or weight based on contribution/stake.  
- Proposal Tracking: Members can create, discuss, and track proposals easily.  
- Soundness Layer: Guarantees proof of fairness and verifiable results.

## Architecture Overview
1. Smart contract to handle proposal creation and vote tallying.  
2. Wallet integration for voter authentication.  
3. Soundness Layer verification for fair results.  
4. UI dashboard for creating and voting on proposals.  

---

## Development Timeline
- Week 1: Core voting smart contract.  
- Week 2: Wallet integration and Soundness Layer verification.  
- Week 3: Front-end dashboard for proposal creation and voting.  
- Week 4: Testing with community governance proposals.

## Expected Outcome
A transparent governance platform that empowers the Soundness community to make collective decisions, ensuring trust through on-chain voting and Soundness Layer verification.
